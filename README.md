# sequence-to-video-converter

My personal project created in 2020, which I use in my work. 
The application is used to convert sequences rendered with a 3D Software into a video file. 
You just need to specify the path to one of the sequence files, the program will analyze its name and 
create a video file from all files of this sequence. 
This application is present in two versions, a script without a GUI. And an application with an interface made using Qt QML.
